    {title: "As We Wrap It Around Those Woollend Wings", 
    description: "I used to work in a carpet shop. A house made out of fine wool, established in Antwerp for more than a not-long-enough-to-get-rid-of-them century. Despite all our efforts, we would keep finding some of them, or traces of their passage, hidden somewhere between the knots of a rug that escaped our attention. The fight that our species wages against theirs is ongoing, and not epic at all. They don’t seem to mind it that much and prove to be incredibly resilient against our efforts, sticking with us for centuries. Because of our knowledge in making fabric, moths live among us. ",
