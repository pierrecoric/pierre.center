    {title: "Data visualization fo the rain precipitation in the city of Marrakesh", 
    description: "During an art residency in Marrakesh, I decided to work with public meteorological data, more specifically, the rain precipitation data. I played around with this material until I found a compelling form to engage a conversation around this topic. I processed the data with Python and rendered some potential forms in Blender to finally settle on a sculptural solution that I could produce with the help and advice of a wood craftsman. I produced picture files and textual dimensions for each of the separated pieces. He produced them in his woodshop, and I assembled them for the final exhibition at Le 18. \n the piece is titled As If It Was Making the Grass Happy to Grow",

    {title: "Knitting the DNA sequence of a sheep", 
    description: "For this piece titled As We Wrap It Around Those Woolen Wings, my plan was to knit a fraction of the DNA sequence of a sheep. The data is public and was found with the help of a biologist friend, Coco Koedooder. I used an old domestic knitting machine, with the help of the artist Ilse Van Roy and her assistant Annelies Clerix. \n The software that can communicate with this machine is called Designaknit and is actually quite simple. I just had to generate bitmap images with the right dimensions. However, due to the small memory capacity of the machine, I also had to slice the sequence into many parts. I accomplished this with a simple processing script reading the DNA sequence from a text file.",
